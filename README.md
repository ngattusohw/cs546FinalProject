Pokemon Database and usage site

Our website uses a pokemon api to get information for you about any pokemon that you want.
It can also give you our best guess at a pokemon which will be able to beat your rival.

Our site features a user database, a place to test pokemon matchups, and a built in forum to give us feedback. You can aslo save pokemon for later in your favorites list.
